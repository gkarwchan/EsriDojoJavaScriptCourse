this runner allows you to run unit test, while you are referencing dojo from the ESRI's CDN.

for esri < 3.0 use : esri_custom_runner_28 (before dojo 17).html
for esri => 3.0 which uses Dojo syntax =>1.7 use: esri_custom_runner_32.html

for the first , just place the html file in the doh directory
for the second place the two files: esri_custom_runner_32.html and loadtests.js

Please note that you can make the code better.
